    <p>The interactive map above depicts the locations of police shootings within the past couple of decades. Each circle marker represents a different person and location. Data points when clicked include information on the race of each wounded individual and what type of weapon he/she was wielding if any. (Data from Alaska and Hawaii can be accessed by dragging the map to their locations.)</p>
    <p>The colors of each marker represent different United States regions, including the West Coast (yellow), Rockies (purple), Plains (orange), Midwest (blue), Southeast (red), and East Coast (green).</p>
    <p>Race/Ethnicity is defined by the outline of each circle marker. The smaller circles represent people of unknown race. The circles with a lighter black outline represent people who are White, and the circles with a darker black outline represent people who are Minorities.
    <p>This map was supported by Leaflet.js, OpenStreetMap, and crowdsourced data from <a href="http://regressing.deadspin.com/deadspin-police-shooting-database-update-were-still-go-1627414202">Deadspin.</a></p>
